# Giphygram Project

This project has been deployed at: https://krish-310.github.io/Giphygram-Project/

I created a Progressive Web App (PWA) that uses the Giphy API to fetch the top 12 most highly trending gifs at the time and displays them on the site. The site is implemented with a service worker and deployed on GitHub Pages. 

Features:
- Responsive Layout
- Compatible with native systems 
- Retains basic functionality while offline
- Other benefits as well

I followed a tutorial from Udemy on PWAs to make this project.
